    This post **DOES** include affiliate links. If you found this content useful, please consider buying the products displayed using the provided links.

    You will pay the same amount as normal, however, it does provide a small benefit to me. This benefit is usually used to purchase other products and hardware for which I can review / blog about.

    As a disclaimer, I do not display advertisements on this site. I do not accept donations.
    
    As such, the only compensation from this service, comes from affiliate links.

    I am a normal person, who plays with these projects in my spare time. 
    
    I do not run a company with sponsored youtube channels. 

    If you see a product linked on my blog, It means I paid for it out of my pocket, for my own personal uses, unless otherwise noted.

    This blog exists for the sole reason, of documenting my various projects and experiences, to share with others.

    If, you do not wish to use the links, you are under no obligation to click them.
