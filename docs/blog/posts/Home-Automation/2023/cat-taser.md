# FADD - Feline Area Denial Device

My wife presented me with a unique challenge recently. 

"The cats keep getting on top of the kitchen table, and getting hair everywhere!"

So- the logically minded person I am- I decided to build a home-assistant integrated device for keeping cats off of the table!

I present to you, the **FADD**. Feline Area Denial Device!

!!! danger "üî• Fire Hazard"
    This project presents a potential fire hazard. Do not use this around anything flammable. Do not use this unsupervised. üî•üöí

!!! danger
    This project should not be used around pets or small children. üêàÔ∏èüêïÔ∏èü§∏

!!! caution
    Make sure you read the disclaimers! 

    Also- you probably should not build this. 

## The concept

The concept is simple. I will use Frigate, combined with a Google Corral TPU, to detect when the cats are near the kitchen table.

When the kittys are either on, or near the kitchen table, I will trigger a taser like device. 

This taser like device, is not intended to shock or physical harm anyone, and is mounted away from kids and pets.

The idea- the taser-like sound, will scare away the cats. 

## The End Result


## Build / Assembly

### Software Used

1. [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/){target=_blank}
    * This is my home automation platform of choice.
2. [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/){target=_blank}
    * This is the firmware I typically run on my ESP-based projects
3. [Frigate](https://frigate.video/){target=_blank}
    * I am leveraging Frigate, combined with a Google Coral TPU to detect objects.

### Parts needed

1. "High-Voltage" Generator.
    * [Amazon](https://amzn.to/45IoJyV){target=_blank}
    * I ended up picking up 5 of these, for 20$ shipped, or 4$ each. However, you can buy just a single module for 10$.
    * This converts the incoming 5v, into around 40kv. (Ignore the 400kv claim... that is false. But, based on my math, it does generate 40-50kv)
2. 5v 3 amp power supply
    * [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3WLiWEM){target=_blank}
    * I suppose you could use a normal 2amp USB brick, however, I opted for this 3 amp power supply instead.
3. ESP32
    * [Amazon](https://amzn.to/43lNxLC){target=_blank}
    * I had a bunch of ESP32s laying around, however, you COULD instead use a [ESP8266](https://amzn.to/3CdA7Fz){target=_blank} or [D1 Mini](https://amzn.to/3OS1XP6){target=_blank} for a cheaper.
    * I went with the ESP32, to also try out the new [Esphome Bluetooth Proxy functionality](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy.html){target=_blank}. 
    * But- for this project, the ESP32 offers no additional required functionality over what a ESP8266-based module provides.
4. Some form of enclosure
    * [Amazon](https://amzn.to/42geTBq){target=_blank}
    * A few years back, I picked up a bunch of these ABS plastic enclosures. They occasionally come in handy for projects exactly like this.
    * I recommend a non-conductive enclosure, due to the high-voltages here.
5. MOSFET OR Relay module
    * [MOSFET - Amazon](https://amzn.to/45HNjzY){target=_blank}
    * I went with a MOSFET over a traditional relay, because I wanted to see if I could pass a PWM signal to the step-up coil to alter the frequency of the sound generated.
    * I will note, I was unsuccessful in doing so. However- these little modules do work quite nicely. You can substitute a relay instead, with minor changes to wiring
    * [Relay - Amazon](https://amzn.to/43wTFAm){target=_blank}
    * DO note- whichever solution you choose will need to be able to be triggered via 3v signal. 
    
Overall, I'd estimate I spent around 50$ for this project, HOWEVER, I have enough components to build 5 of these things, if I wanted.

### OTHER Hardware Used

1. [Reolink E1](https://amzn.to/3PbCv7B){target=_blank}
    * I always recommend using a hard-wired POE camera over a wireless camera. However, this is a temporary project, which will not be permanently attached. 
    * But, for 30$ a piece, these wireless cameras do come in quite handy for quick POC, testing, and other purposes.
    * For permanent mount cameras, my current recommendation is the [Reolink RLC-520](https://amzn.to/3MQKROS){target=_blank}
2. [Google Coral USB Accelerator](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Coral-USB-Accelerator-p-2899.html){target=_blank}
    * IF you can get your hands on one of these, it greatly accelerates how quickly objects can be detected.
    * It also allows you to perform object detection, while hardly using CPU resources.


### Wiring

Please forgive my drawing. However, the wiring of this project is extremely simple.

![](assets-cat-taser/Wiring-Diagram.webP)

From your 5V power supply- 

Connect positive to:

1. VIN plug of your selected ESP device. (NOT the 3.3v link!!)
2. Positive input of your MOSFET or relay.

Connect negative/ground to:

1. GND pin of your selected ESP device. There are a few GND pins, pick your favorite.
2. Negative input of your MOSFET or relay.

Connect the OUTPUTs of your MOSFET, to the inputs of the "high-voltage generator" (The side with a blue wire)

Finally, connect a GPIO from the ESP to the MOSFET. I went with GPIO12. However, as long as you don't choose a [reserved GPIO](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-pinout-reference-gpios/){target=_blank}, you should be fine.

In hindsight- I should have used GPIO16 - 33 as there is nothing special about those pins, and they are capable of generating a PWM signal, if you want to experiment.

Connect the GPIO to the TRIG/PWM input of the MOSFET.

### Assembly

For assembly, I only used a few tools:

1. Soldering iron- for soldering wires to pins / connections.
2. Hot Glue Gun - To hold everything in place. 
    * This is a cheap, quick POC project. Hot glue will work just fine here.
3. A drill
    * Used to make a hole for the DC 5v PIN.

First, solder all of the connections noted in the previous step.

Next, I drilled a hole for the DC 5v PIN, and then used hot glue to hold the plug into place.

Finally- I carefully placed the remaining components inside of the case. 

![](./assets-cat-taser/assembled-lid-off.webP)

After careful organization, I snapped the lid into place, and soldered the high-voltage leads into a mostly-fixed position. 

Do note, altering the distance between the leads will alter the sound/frequency which is emitted. 

![](./assets-cat-taser/assembled-zapper.webP)

The only concern I would be aware of during assembly- Try to keep the high-voltage leads as far away from the ESP as possible! Otherwise, you may end up zapping it.

!!! danger
    Make sure to affix the high-voltage leads into a position where the ARC is NOT near anything flammable OR conductive. 

    This **CAN** present a fire / shock risk. You have been warned.

The last step- is to place the unit somewhere secure, away from children and pets.

### Esphome Firmware

For this project, I am using [Esphome](https://esphome.io/index.html){target=_blank}. It supports all of the functionality I need, and it easily integrates with Home Assistant, and MQTT, allowing me to easily automate it.

Here is the configuration file I am using:

``` yaml  title="cat-zapper.yaml"
substitutions:
  devicename: "cat_zapper"
  friendly_name: "Cat Zapper"
  ip_address: 10.1.2.3
  gateway: 10.1.2.1
  <<: !include secrets.yaml

<<: !include common/common.yaml

esphome:
  name: ${devicename}
  friendly_name: ${friendly_name}

esp32:
  board: esp32dev
  variant: esp32

sensor: 
  # Wifi Signal
  - <<: !include common/sensor-wifi-signal.yaml

  # Uptime
  - <<: !include common/sensor-uptime.yaml
    
button:
  # Restart Button
  - <<: !include common/button-restart.yaml

  # Safe Mode Button
  - <<: !include common/button-safemode.yaml

  - platform: output
    output: zap
    name: "Zapper"
    duration: 400ms

output:
  - platform: gpio
    pin: GPIO12
    id: zap

# Uncomment if you would like a web interface
# web_server:
#   port: 80  
```


Regarding the contents of the "common" files, I have those documented here: [ESPhome Common](/pages/esphome/esphome-common/){target=_blank}. I use this include functionality, to keep my configuration files cleaner, and to avoid repeating the same configuration in multiple locations.

For my configuration, I used a `Button` to trigger this device. This uses the [generic output button](https://esphome.io/components/button/output.html){target=_blank}, which allows me to trigger a GPIO output for a determined amount of time.

You can alter the duration of the "Zaps" by adjusting the duration parameter in the above configuration. 

!!! info
    The reason I am leveraging a generic output button, instead of a GPIO switch, is to control the duration during which this device is active. I wanted to greatly reduce the possibility of this device getting stuck in an "ON" position, which would greatly elevate the risk of fire.


## The Automation

### Frigate Configuration

After configuring this camera in Frigate, I had a video stream.

![](./assets-cat-taser/kitchen-view.webP)

However, I really only care when there is a `cat` on or near the kitchen table. I don't want to waste resources detecting people walking near the table.

So, I created a motion mask, and masked off all of the areas I do not care about. This left me with the following view:

![](./assets-cat-taser/kitchen-masked.webP)

Do note, this is a color camera. However, since the room is currently uninhabited and dark- it is in "night vision" mode, which is black and white only.

After everything was completed, here is what I was left with:

``` yaml title="Frigate Config.yaml"
objects:
  filters:
    cat:
      # I lowered the score for detecting cats slightly, to improve detections.
      min_score: 0.4
      threshold: 0.6


cameras:
  kitchen:
    detect:
      width: 640
      height: 354
      fps: 7
    ffmpeg:
      inputs:
          # This path is specifically for a Reolink E1. As well, I am using the sub-stream for detection. 
        - path: rtsp://YourUser:YourPassword@10.1.2.3:554/h264Preview_01_sub
          roles:
            - detect
            - record
    motion:
      mask:
        - 502,304,366,354,640,354,640,277,640,181,640,0,0,0,0,354,202,354,115,206,173,134,227,61,442,58,473,93,569,101
    zones: # I also created a specific zone, for the areas I am wanting to detect cats.
      zone_0:
        coordinates: 0,354,329,354,475,354,530,333,581,108,447,39,269,40,0,42
    objects:
      track:
        - cat
```

With these settings, over the last few days, I have gotten extremely accurate detections.

### Home Assistant Configuration

I will be adding the actual automation inside of Home Assistant. The automation is actually quite simple.

![](./assets-cat-taser/home-assistant-automation.webP)

``` yaml
alias: Cat Taser
description: Fire the lasers
trigger:
  - type: occupied
    platform: device
    device_id: 94e0766834ecff68ee26b72f231499de
    entity_id: binary_sensor.zone_0_cat_occupancy
    domain: binary_sensor
condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: input_boolean.mode_vacation
    state: "off"
action:
  - repeat:
      while:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.kitchen_cat_occupancy
          state: "on"
      sequence:
        - device_id: 914217f5ad93dc688d9d6f3ea86e1b29
          domain: button
          entity_id: button.cat_zapper_zapper
          type: press
        - delay:
            hours: 0
            minutes: 0
            seconds: 5
            milliseconds: 0
mode: single
```

1. When `binary_sensor.zone_0_cat_occupancy` turns on (ie. there is a cat inside of zone 0)
2. AND, I am not on vacation
3. THEN, Press the "zapper"  button every 5 seconds, until there is no longer a cat inside of zone 0.

That's it!

## Does it work?

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LLRK-PZC91s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I WOULD have more videos, however, after deploying this device- the first two videos didn't come through with any sound. And, after the 3rd detection- the cats have not returned to the kitchen table.

Overall, I would call this a success... as not a single cat hair has been found on top of the kitchen table since deployment.

And- this can be easily repurposed for other areas of the house.
