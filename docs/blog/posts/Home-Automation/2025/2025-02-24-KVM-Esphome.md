# Hacking a cheap KVM with IP Control

I picked up a PiKVM a few months back. I finally got to use it earlier this week when [Comparing Link Speed to Power Consumption](../../Technology/2025/2025-02-22-LinkSpeed-Vs-PowerConsumption.md){target=_blank}.

But- it only works for a single PC. I need a solution for all four SFFs/Micros in my rack.

So... I picked up a cheap Display Port KVM for 70$, and hacked it to be controllable via Home Assistant.

<!-- more -->

## The Goal

The goal is simple. I want to be able to control a KVM switch from Home Assistant.

For- the immediate need, I will control a KVM switch behind PiKVM, allowing me to remotely access and control all 4 PCs in my rack, which do not have iDrac.

For the future need, I'd love to automate the KVM in my office. But- before touching my more expensive KVM switch, I wanted to test a proof of concept with a cheap one.

### Hardware Used

[4 Port DisplayPort KVM Switch](https://amzn.to/3Qznf3S){target=_blank}[^amazon]

There is nothing fancy here. Costed me 70$

It is a simple DP 1.2 KVM. I don't even think it supports EDID emulation.

[Espressif D1 Mini](https://amzn.to/4ie72N3){target=_blank}[^amazon]

Cheap, effective micro controller. I just ordered another 20 ESP32-C3s for future projects. Can pick these up from 99 cents to a few bucks each.

Even an older ESP8266 will be fine for this project. There are no special requirements.

I had an old crusty one laying around, which I ended up using.

### Tools Used

A soldering iron. Solder. Flux.

A screwdriver.

Basic hand tools.

A multimeter.

## Execution

First step, was to unpack the switch.

Right away- you can notice I have four HDMI cables........ in a box for a DisplayPort KVM.

Next, we need to remove the cover. Two phillips #2 head screws on each side.

Afterwards, we can see the interior.

### A slight bit of reverse engineering

The layout is extremely simple. 

We can see Four switching chips. And- follow the traces.

![alt text](./assets-kvm/dp-traces.webP)

So, each pair of DP ports, goes into a switch. Then the pair of switches, goes into another switch.

This circled area, is where my interest is. This is the area where the buttons, and control hardware are.

![alt text](./assets-kvm/control-area.webP)

So- just need to tie into the correct traces in order to activate the desired outputs.

I started with this [Cheap Oscilloscope](https://amzn.to/4igKImd){target=_blank}[^amazon] that I picked up for 30$. I wouldn't recommend one.

I used my automotive multimeter instead....  Don't buy one of these. Its not even a good toy.

![alt text](./assets-kvm/finesi-scope.webP)

So- to determine which pins did what- I simply toggled the outputs and probed the chip using my multimeter. 

As well, I had this suspicion the included remote, did not actually use USB. I decided to open it up. 

A knife was the easy tool here. Slide in in, and wedge the case apart.

![alt text](./assets-kvm/remote-knife.webP)

Low and behold- No circuitry for USB. Just a simple remote. 

When you press a button, it pulls that line low.

### Soldering Connections

I planned on using ESPHome from the start. now, I just need to start adding connections.

For wire, I used a piece of copper CAT6 I had laying around. 

![alt text](./assets-kvm/cat6.webP)

After a while, I had a lovely rat's nest of wire.

![alt text](./assets-kvm/soldering-1.webP)

I felt this was a good time to test everything.

### Adding the ESP

Next, I decided to go ahead and add the ESP.

NORMALLY, I would use a ESP32-C3, however, I am currently out of stock apparently. This old crusty d1 mini was all I had laying around.

To attach it, a bit of hot-glue worked just fine.

![alt text](./assets-kvm/esp-glued-down.webP)

From this point, It was just a matter of trimming, and soldering the rest of the connections.

![alt text](./assets-kvm/esp-soldered.webP)

For ground, I soldered a wire to the USB port, which is grounded.

For 5v, I soldered onto the 5V pin of USB Port 1. (5v is shared across all of the ports).

!!! info
    Yes- I know- my soldering looks like ðŸ’©

    Minus- this website- nobody will ever physically see this again.

    And- despite the looks, it will function the same now, as it will in 5 years from now.

At this point, all of the physical modifications are done.

Once you have initially flashed the ESP, you can reassemble the case.



### To Do...

Add ESPHome Config.
