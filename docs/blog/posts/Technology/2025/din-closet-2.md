# DIN Mount Network Closet - Part 2 - Final construction and cleanup

This is part two, of a three post series.

* [Part 1](din-closet-1.md), I built the wooden frame. 
* Part 2, we will be turning the wooden frame into my networking panel.
* [Part 3](din-closet-3.md) will be mounting networking components, and wire management.

In case you missed part 1, here was the end result:

## Step 1. Planning

A while back, I made [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1ht2vh1/cad_software_nah_mspaint_planning_to_din_mount_my/){target=_blank} which demonstrated a pretty... ugly layout in Microsoft paint.

While- apparently may felt this was a joke, and it was not very well received- it was indeed.... the actual plan.

For context- here is the image I posted:

Well- in this post- I am going to make the ugly drawing a reality.

But first...

## Step 2. Paint

I am going to make it look a bit better.

I will start with... some stain and poly, along with some white paint for the trim.

That, helped quite a bit.

## Step 3. Layout

Here is where we get to the interesting part. Doing mock, and layout.

I started with DIN Rails, a old EdgeRouter, and a small plastic container the same size as my Unifi USW-8s.

The goal here, was to get a feel for how much room I had to work with.

Next- I wanted to include a patch panel. So- I slapped it on there to get started.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/layout-2.webP)

After playing with it a bit- I was convinced it would need to be mounted perpendicular to the frame, as I was not happy flush mounting it.

So... I needed to build a 1U mount.

### Building 1U mount

Looking at my material options, I had steel, and I had wood.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/steel-or-wood.webP)

Steel, seemed like the best option. So- I started bending steel.

A simple hammer and vise was the only thing needed here.

Checking fitment.

After cutting.

Now... I just needed to make a 2nd one.

A few minutes later.... We have a 2nd one.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/mount-2.webP)

I did leverage my anvil to help shape these a bit more.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/anvil.webP)

And... a bit more tweaking in the vise.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/vise.webP)

I wanted both of these to be nearly identical.

#### Drilling Holes

!!! warning
    I made a pretty big mistake in this section.

    I decided to leave it. See.... if you can spot it.

After tracing the holes, I went over to the drill press, and used a 2x4 to keep everything positioned while clamping.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/drill-1.webP)

I used a step bit, my sliding vise, and some cutting oil.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/drill-2.webP)

After drilling the holes, I used a chamfering bit to chamfer the holes.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/drill-3.webP)

Finally- I did a quick mock-up.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/drill-4.webP)

(Random note- the black thing in the background is a ESP-controlled 3 head flamethrower)

#### Finishing Brackets

With- the brackets looking promising, I just needed to do some cleanup now.

I started with tracing out around the patch panel.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/bracket-finish-1.webP)

Next, I took a rough cut using a die-grinder with a cut-off wheel.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/bracket-finish-2.webP)

And, finally finished these up using flap disks and a angle grinder.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/bracket-finish-3.webP)

#### Patch Panel Mounted

To mount to the frame, I decided to use some 5/8" bolts.

Complete overkill, but, I have quite a few of these.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/bracket-mount-1.webP)

!!! question
    Remember, earlier when I said I messed up on something?

    Have- you spotted it yet?

Bracket and patch panel mounted.

### Layout Finished

Ok, with the patch panel mounted, I can continue layout.

And... its done. (Suppose- I did not take any pictures during this portion)

## Step 4. Mounting

Well, first is first, need to clear a spot to hang this.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/clearing-a-spot.webP)

This is going to be a tight fit.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/tight-fit.webP)

After validating it will fit, I took some measurements and installed the back-half of the "wedge mount"

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/wall-mount-installed.webP)

And, then I just slid the "shelf" onto the mount. It locked securely into place without issue.

![alt text](./assets-din-closet-2/mounted.webP)

Thats, honestly it for this section. The only remaining item is to start mounting networking hardware.

I will make part 3 for that.
