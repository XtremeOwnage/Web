# Learning about how a computer works and about electronics

Want to learn about how a computer works?

Not- at a high level.... 

But, at a very, very low level, where you literally build a functional computer from transistors. 

If so- this is a list of resources which I have found extremely handy for myself.

Also, because ADHD.... there is also a list of automation centric games, channels involving lasers, plasma, etc.

<!-- more -->

## Building.... a PC from scratch.

For learning the basics- one of the BEST resources I have found, is a simple game.

[NAND Game](https://nandgame.com/){target=_blank}

In this game- you will go through the process of literally assembling a functional computer, using nothing more then a bunch of relays. 

### Had a lot of fun, but, want wish you could play more?

Well, [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague){target=_blank} built a circuit simulator, which feels much like NAND Game.

You can find it here: [Digital-Logic-Sim](https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim){target=_blank}

Want some more context? He has a [video series exploring how computers work, using the above tool.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq){target=_blank}

### Want to build your own PC from scratch and play tetris on it?

If so, you will want to go take a look at [James Sherman](https://www.youtube.com/@weirdboyjim){target=_blank}

His channel is dedicated to a homemade 8-bit pipelined CPU.

The populated PCBs you see in his most recent video- those aren't off the shelf.

James literally designed them. Every component has a related video series.

ALU design, UART, Audio, Memory, File Systems... ALL of it.

## Thats all nice, but, I just want to make a video game.

If so- check out [Javid9](https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9/videos){target=_blank}

Very little assembly here- and the channel is mostly focused on writing graphical applications (games) in c++.

However, he does have an entire series on writing a NES emulator.

He explains all of the math in an easy to understand way. 

### Know what, I just want to PLAY a video game, and learn more about writing code

Understandable. I have a few resources for you.

[Screeps](https://screeps.com/){target=_blank} is an online "MMO" where you program "bots" using javascript.

[Stationeers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/544550/Stationeers/) is a resource management / survival simulator where you build a space station, and... manage resources, and elements in order to survive.

#### I don't actually want to play the game.... I just want to watch it.

Then, I suppose you can watch [CowsAreEvil](https://www.youtube.com/@cowsareevil7514){target=_blank} play it for you, and write the assembly.

#### I REALLY love automation-focused games.

So do I! Here are my favorites-

1. [Oxygen Not Included](https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/){target=_blank}
2. [Factorio](https://factorio.com/){target=_blank}
    - One of the most optimized 2D Automation games around. 
    - Very interesting [Devblog](https://factorio.com/blog/){target=_blank} too.
3. [Shapez](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2162800/shapez_2/){target=_blank}
    - Imagine factorio, but, much simpler. Much more casual.
1. [Mindustry](https://mindustrygame.github.io/){target=_blank}
    - Tower-defense, with automation and resource management.
    - And, you can play it on your phone.
3. [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/){target=_blank}
    - Factorio, but, in 3D!
4. [Dyson Sphere Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/){target=_blank}
    - Satisfactory- but, at Universe Scale!
5. [Stationeers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/544550/Stationeers/){target=_blank}
    - In space, and space is trying to kill you!

And, let me share one last game.

[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us){target=_blank}

At this point, you might be wondering why it is being mentioned under a section about automation-based games.....

Quite simply, Some of the modded variants have automation-based gameplay, which goes into more depth then most of the games listed above.

* [Feed The Beast](https://feed-the-beast.com/){target=_blank}
* [Gregtech: NH](https://www.gtnewhorizons.com/){target=_blank}

Take- Gregtech for example. It can have extremely complex resource diagrams, for producing materials. [Platinum, for example](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/fpilxl/as_we_seem_to_be_sharing_flowcharts_heres_the_new/){target=_blank}

Personally- I have spent more hours on the automation centric minecraft mods, then I have spent on any of the games listed about.

Oh. And.... on the note of this post's original topic....

[You can build a computer, in minecraft. Which plays minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=-BP7DhHTU-I&t=7s){target=_blank}

So- don't be quick to discredit it, based on its blocky graphics.

## I don't care about the software, I want to learn more about electronics!

I have resources for that too!

Visit [EEVblog](https://www.youtube.com/@EEVblog){target=_blank} where you can meet Dave, who really enjoys electrical engineering. 

Or, if you prefer a bit more humor-

Check out [ElectroBOOM](https://www.youtube.com/@ElectroBOOM){target=_blank}, where you can learn about electrical engineering while watching Mehdi shock himself. 

### Oh, that last one was funny. DO- you have anything like this, but, more dangerous?? I like danger!

You can watch... [PhotonicInduction](https://www.youtube.com/@Photonicinduction){target=_blank} who will casually play with many things you should not step near.

Although- be warned- he disappears for years at a time. We, aren't yet sure if he finally electrocuted himself, or was locked in prison for causing an widespread grid outage.

### I like lasers and lightning. I want to build a death ray.

[StyroPyro](https://www.youtube.com/@styropyro){target=_blank} is your man. 

#### Plasma is cool. Cna I learn more?

[Plasmachannel](https://www.youtube.com/@PlasmaChannel){target=_blank} has your back.

### I just want to see random short videos involving electrical components.

[GreatScott](https://www.youtube.com/@greatscottlab/videos){target=_blank} is an interesting fellow, with interesting videos. The content is pretty random, but, typically gravitates to electronics. 

But- unlike the really, REALLY stupid shorts you see while death-browsing on facebook... these videos are actually useful, and educational.
