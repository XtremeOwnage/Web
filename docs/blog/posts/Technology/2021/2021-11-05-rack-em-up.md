# Rack em up - Adding a proper rack

I have a few pieces of enterprise gear for my home network. I have my server, a few 10/40G POE switches, and some other odds and ends. So far, its been stacked on boxes and buckets inside of my spare bedroom’s closet.

So, over the last two weeks, I started a project to clean everything up a little bit.

## Before and After

### Before

![](./assets-rack-em-up/1_old_rack.webP)

As you can see in the above picture…. its a bit of a mess. 

My switch on the left is sitting on a cardboard box. 

My server lives on top of a 5gal home depot bucket…. and everything else is just “in there”.

### After

After - Rack pulled out of the closet.

After, Rack neatly inside of the closet.

And- as a bonus, the closet doors can even close now!

(Although, as of re-publishing this in 2023- there is far too much heat generated to leave the doors closed now...)

## The Process

### Cleaning up the closet

So, the first goal, was to pull everything out of the closet, and remove the left-over spike strip from whenever this closet had carpet once upon a time.

As you can see in the below image, spike strip was around the entire perimeter. It could… be bad if a power cord got pinched on top of this. So- the tools required for this job- Just a simple hammer and pry-bar.

After a bunch of beating and prying spike strip, Half way there…..

![](./assets-rack-em-up/spike-strip-removed.webP)

And… done. Used the trusty shop-vac to clean up all of the remaining dust, fragments, etc.

### Populating the rack

So, after the closet was cleaned up, my first goal was to move my [2.4Kwh](https://xtremeownage.com/2021/06/12/portable-2-4kwh-power-supply-ups/){target=_blank} UPS into the closet. If you have interest in building your own portable 2.4Kwh (or bigger) UPS, feel free to click that link. So far, it has worked fantastically, without issues.

!!! info
    As of Dec 2023, this UPS is still in place, and still works perfectly.

And, knock on wood, it fit into this space perfectly. The smaller UPS is used for a few smaller devices not mounted on my rack.

And, next, through the magic of…. editing, here is the final photo of the rack already populated.

And- when I need to “hide” the rack… it fits nicely into the closet!

And- of course, the closet doors still shut.

## FAQs / Comments

**Q: Why are you using two separate patch panels?**

A: Due to how my rack slides in/out of the closet, the cables come into the rear of my rack. To allow me to pull the rack OUT of the closet to perform maintenance, I wanted the cables coming in at the rear to give plenty of space.

**Q: Will it get too hot in the closet?**

A: Absolutely. The door will remain open until a proper ventilation system is created.

**Q: Will the “THIN” patch cables work for POE / 10G?**

A: I was curious myself. Turns out, none of my POE devices are having issues, and all of the 10G links are working without issue, and no packet errors are reported on the switches.

A note- My expectations for the startech rack were not very high, as it was pretty cheap. I was half-way expecting to receive a flimsy rack, not suitable for my heavy servers. I was pleasantly surprised, the build quality is actually…. pretty nice. The parts are thick and solid.

!!! info
    Edit from Dec 2023- This rack has held up perfectly fine, with no issues at all.

    Would strongly recommend. The thin patch cables have been absolutely fantastic. I still love these. A new post will be coming soon hopefully of the changes over the last few years.

## Future Ideas / Projects

1. Cleanup some of the CAT6 in the closet. I have drops coming from both the floor, and ceiling. It would be nice to make this a bit… neater. Its a mess still.
    * As of 2024 - Issue is worse! Now there is also multiple fiber runs coming through the floor! But, is better organized now.
2. Apply SOME form of flooring to the closet. The old plywood is not easy on the eyes.
    * Yup. This is still ugly too.
3. It would be nice to have rails on the floor, to allow the rack to slide into and out of the closet with ease, every time.
    * This likely isn't going to ever happen.
