# How to subscribe to kbin from lemmy

Say, you found a community you want to subscribe to. Buts its on kbin.social, and you cannot figure out how to subscribe from lemmy.

I will be using <https://kbin.social/m/amitheasshole/microblog> as an example here.

## Step 1. Copy the url.

In this case, we just need, https://kbin.social/m/amitheasshole/microblog

## Step 2. Get your instance's URL.

In my case, my primary instance is https://lemmyonline.com/

## Step 3. Combined the two.

{instance_url}/c/{kbin}

So-

https://lemmyonline.com/c/@kbinMeta@kbin.social
