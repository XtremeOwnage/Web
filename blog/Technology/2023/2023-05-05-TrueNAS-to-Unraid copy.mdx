# How to migrate from TrueNAS to Unraid

Step by step directions to export your existing zfs array from TrueNAS, and import into Unraid.

## The Process

### Step 1. Create backups

Take a backup of your TrueNAS configuration, and keep somewhere safe. 

### Step 2. Fetch Data

You will likely want...

1. A list of custom users/groups you have added, along with any special attributes.
2. Take note of any existing NFS/SMB shares you have.
3. You will need `/etc/exports`, if you would like to present your existing NFS shares, via your existing Zpool. 






### Re-adding your existing NFS shares.

I wanted to mount my existing zpool, and re-present my NFS shares while data was copying to the new drives. To do this, you will need to...

1. Add the contents of `/etc/exports` from your TrueNAS box, into `/etc/exports` on the Unraid box. 
2. Reload NFS exports via `exportfs -ra`

Thats, it. At this point, all of your NFS shares are up and working from TrueNAS.
